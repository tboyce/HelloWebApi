# HelloWebApi

Demonstrates REST, DTO, dependency injection and repository patterns using ASP.NET Web API.
Concerns suchs as validation and security have been omitted from this demo, but would be required in a real enterprise service.

Run the project and go to [http://localhost:28065/api/greetings](http://localhost:28065/api/greetings) in your browser.
You can only test GETs with your browser.
To test other REST verbs you will need to use [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or a browser extension such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
